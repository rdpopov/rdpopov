### Hello there
<!-- General Kenobi -->

- AOC 2022, Let's gooo! https://adventofcode.com/

- Iâ€™m currently learning 
  Rust and Lua(for neovim) \
  And any other language that catches my eye. \
  Tried many, but most of them didn't stick.\
  Nim has been favourite so far. And lua the most nifty.
